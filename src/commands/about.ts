      Colour me! is a bot that allows server admins to give users the ability to change the colour of their own assigned colour roles!

      **Server admin commands**:
      \`/colour-role add <role>\`:
      Add a role to the list of roles that are allowed to change their own colour!

      \`/colour-role remove <role>\`:
      Remove a role previously added to the list of allowed roles!

      \`/colour-role list\`:
      See the current list of roles!

      All of these require the \`Manage Roles\` permission.
      Make sure the role you're adding already has a colour before you add it!

      **User commands**:
      \`/colour-me random\`:
      Change your role colour to a random colour!!

      \`/colour-me colour <hexcode>\`:
      Change your role colour to a specific hex code!

      \`/about\`:
      That's this, you're reading it!

      **Planned features**:
      In the near future it is planned to have functionality to allow admins and optionally users to create their own coloured roles automatically.
